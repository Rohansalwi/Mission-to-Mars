# Mission to Mars
## Web-scraping project

### Purpose

Build an APP to scrape data from websites for our mission to mars projects and then create an HTML page to show our findings.

### Step 1 using Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb:
Code is written to retrieve the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
Full-resolution images of the hemispheres are added to the dictionary.
Titles for the images are added to the dictionary.
A list is created containing the dictionary of the full-resolution image URL string and title for each hemisphere image.
### Step 2 creating the HTML and creating a function to scrape the images with the scraping.py file:
Created a scraping.py file to retrieve the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
A Mongo database is updated to contain the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image.
Index.html file contains code that will display the full-resolution image URL and title for each hemisphere image. After the scraping is done, the web app delivers all the information from this module and the full-resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images.
